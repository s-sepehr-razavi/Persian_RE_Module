# üáÆüá∑ ParsRelEx: Persian Relation Extraction

## üåü Overview

**ParsRelEx** is a project focused on **Relation Extraction (RE)** for the **Persian (Farsi) language**. It leverages the state-of-the-art **ATLOP** (Adaptive Thresholding and Ordering for Link Prediction) model architecture, fine-tuned using the **ParsBERT** model as its backbone, to accurately identify semantic relationships between entities in Persian text.

This repository provides:

1. The **training code and methodology** based on the ATLOP architecture.
2. A standalone **Inference Module** for practical, zero-shot relation extraction.
3. A simple **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for interactive usage and demonstration.

## üöÄ Features

- **High Accuracy:** Uses the robust **ATLOP** model for effective relation extraction.
- **Persian-Native:** Employs **ParsBERT** to capture the nuances of the Persian language.
- **Easy Inference:** A dedicated Python module for quick and simple predictions.
- **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface for non-programmatic testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

To use the inference module, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-sepehr-razavi/Persian_RE_Module.git
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python packages using the provided requirements.txt file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíæ Model Weights

To run the model, you must download the **pre-trained model weights**.
