# 🇮🇷 ParsRelEx: Persian Relation Extraction

## 🌟 Overview

**ParsRelEx** is a project focused on **Relation Extraction (RE)** for the **Persian (Farsi) language**. It leverages the state-of-the-art **ATLOP** (Adaptive Thresholding and Ordering for Link Prediction) model architecture, fine-tuned using the **ParsBERT** model as its backbone, to accurately identify semantic relationships between entities in Persian text.

This repository provides:
1. The **training code and methodology** based on the ATLOP architecture.
2. A standalone **Inference Module** for practical, zero-shot relation extraction.
3. A simple **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for interactive usage and demonstration.

## 🚀 Features

* **High Accuracy:** Uses the robust **ATLOP** model for effective relation extraction.
* **Persian-Native:** Employs **ParsBERT** to capture the nuances of the Persian language.
* **Easy Inference:** A dedicated Python module for quick and simple predictions.
* **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface for non-programmatic testing.
